# Biobank
Development medical module software for biobank. 

It's my first project in C# written for my master thesis.

ABSTRACT
"Biobank is a unit collecting tissue and cells, which can later be used to research on various diseases.The aim of the thesis was to create a medical module of application used to manage data from biobank, which is dedicated to researchers. It allows for the management of informations about research projects: the description of the literature, experiments, groups, patients, variables, sample materials, samples and results. This project uses ASP.NET Web Forms technology and programming language C#. The data are stored in MS SQL database. The sample data come from the project "Vitamin D receptor gene polymorphisms in Alzheimer's disease patients" conducted in the Laboratory of Molecular Endocrinology, Department of Endocrinology, Diabetology and Isotope Therapy at Wroclaw Medical University in 2014-2015. Obtained software will increase data security and simplify and shorten the process beginning with the development of a research project and ending on receiving the results."
